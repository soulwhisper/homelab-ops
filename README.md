üëã Welcome to my Homelab Operations repository. This is a mono repository for my homelab infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

### :handshake: Thanks

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Homelab](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-homelab) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-homelab](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-homelab) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [Kubernetes @Homelab search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-homelab-search/) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.

I got help from some cool repo like:

- [bjw-s/homelab-ops](https://github.com/bjw-s/homelab-ops)
- [onedr0p/homelab-ops](https://github.com/onedr0p/homelab-ops)
